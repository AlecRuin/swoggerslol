                    His body looks horribly deformed. Yes, I know. Samira's body DOES NOT line up to Dante's at all. 
                    Because of this, the sword is also piercing his back. To fix this, you'd need to reanimate the skin, 
                    and there's around 80 animations for base skin Samira. And I don't get paid to do any of this. My obsession fuels me.
