                    The assets were sourced by Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker. I think. Beej is the one that provided the model, so idk. All rights go to their respective owners. I do not claim to own any of the work/assets used by the mod.
                    I do claim ownership of the <i>effort</i> put behind the formation of the mod itself.
